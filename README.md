A biologically inspired deep neural network robot navigation system for Khepera II mobile robots. Details of the system can be found here: http://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0129065710002577

Infrared sensory information are separated into appropriate hidden clusters and subsequently fused through several layers.

The robot learns and stores knowledge about its environment in the network's self-organized connectivity stimulated by facilitating dynamic synapses [1].

Supervised learning occurs online using hand-crafted rules to associate the appropriate motor output for every environment the robot encounters.

The Khepera II robot can be used or Oliver Michel's simulator: http://home.deec.uc.pt/~pm/RM/manual.pdf
